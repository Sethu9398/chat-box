# TODO: Update Chat Message UI for Inline Time Display

- [x] Modify ChatMessages.jsx to display message time inline with text for text messages, aligned to the right, without wrapping to new line.
- [x] Ensure media messages (image, video, file) keep time below as before.
- [x] Verify that dropdown, selection, and other functionalities remain intact.
- [x] Confirm the UI behaves like WhatsApp for both short and long messages.
